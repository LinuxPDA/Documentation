Notes on W100
-------------

Sharp C7x0 (and C860) models use AMD Imageon 100 (w100) framebuffer as a main graphics unit.
Unfortunately there is little known about this chip. AMD has never released any official
information. There are (were) several efforts to reverse engineer available data and
to provide decent driver for these chips.
